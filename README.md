# CNN Lecture

This is material I created for a tutorial/lecture on Convolutional Neural Networks as part of the [LENS machine learning school](https://lens-initiative.org/2021/03/09/lens-machine-learning-school-2021/), which took place online on February 15-19, 2021.

Both a lecture and a classification hands-on exercise are included in python notebook formats. For the hands-on notebook, a few different versions are included for running on different environments (google colab being one of them).
